              <h3>Who in the heck am I?</h3>
              <p>I am a graphic artist, creative writer, and I also happen to have a passion for computer programing. This might seem like an extremely weird conglomeration of stuff. But trust me, if you want to study something that can be presented to you as a dry, uninteresting, logical set of rules, codes, and endless dreary syntax, then the last thing that you will probably want is some person that eats, sleeps, and breathes just computer programming. You want a creative writer, and perhaps someone who also dapples in art, because that is probably the way you want to approach things anyway. And that is what you will get, logic and syntax written in a way that only a creative artist and writer, could bring you. </p>

              <h3>What will you learn</h3>
              <p>Well, for one I do not just have one book, I have written a series of books on this subject, and what you will learn is a lot, in a very short period of time. That is because you can actually read through one of these books in a day. You see I wanted to make it fast and easy, because I know that you certainly donâ€™t want to be bored learning these things, but you also do not want it to take a whole lot of time doing it either. Your time is precious and even though, you might want to know about this stuff...well, let's just say you can think of a lot better ways to be spending your time. </p>
